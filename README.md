Luhn Algorithm:
1. Starting from the farthest digit to the right, AKA the check digit, iterate to the left.
2. As you iterate to the left, every other digit is doubled (the check digit is not doubled). If the number is greater than 9 after doubling, subtract 9 from its value.
3. Sum up all the digits in the credit card number.
4. If the sum modulo 10 is 0 (if the sum divided by 10 has a remainder of 0) then the number is valid, otherwise, itâ€™s invalid.
